# Tournament Creation System - Implementation Guide

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. Updated Team Data Structure
- **File**: `src/backend/data/competitors.json`
- **Feature**: Each team now includes:
  - `games`: Array of games the team plays (e.g., ["League of Legends", "Counter-Strike"])
  - `region`: Team's region/country
  - **Total teams**: 30+ teams across multiple games

### 2. Team Selection API
- **Controller**: `src/backend/controllers/CompetitorController.js`
- **Routes**: `src/backend/routes/competitorRoutes.js`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/competitors` - Get all teams
  - `GET /api/competitors/by-game/:game` - Get teams by specific game
  - `GET /api/competitors/games` - Get list of available games
  - `GET /api/competitors/:id` - Get specific team details

### 3. Enhanced Tournament Creation Flow

#### Step 1: Basic Information (`create-tournament-1.html`)
- Tournament name input
- Game selection with visual cards
- **NEW**: Real-time team count preview when selecting a game
- Player count specification
- Data saved to localStorage for multi-step process

#### Step 2: Team Selection (`create-tournament-2.html`)
- **NEW**: Dynamic team loading based on selected game
- Visual team cards with logos, descriptions, and game tags
- Multi-select functionality with visual feedback

#### Step 3: Confirmation (`create-tournament-3.html`)

- **NEW**: API integration to actually create tournament
- Success/error handling with user feedback

### 4. Data Persistence
- All tournament creation data saves directly to JSON files
